## General Information

### What is the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)?
The CRS is a points-based system used by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to assess and score your Express Entry profile and rank it in the pool.

### What is the maximum CRS score possible?
With spouse or common-law partner: 1,000 points maximum
Without spouse or common-law partner: 1,200 points maximum

### When am I scored as if I don't have a spouse?
You earn points as if you don't have a spouse or partner if:
- They are not coming with you to Canada, OR
- They are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident

---

## Important Update: Job Offers

### Do I get points for job offers?
No. As of March 25, 2025, job offer points have been removed from the CRS. This includes:
- Senior management positions (Major Group 00): Previously 200 points
- Any other skilled occupation: Previously 50 points

### Do I still need to include my job offer in my profile?
Yes. If having a valid job offer is part of your eligibility criteria (e.g., Federal Skilled Trades Program, Federal Skilled Worker Program, some Provincial Nominee Programs), you should still include it in your Express Entry profile to remain eligible.

## Quick Tips to Maximize Your CRS Score

### 1. Improve language scores
Aim for CLB 9 or higher in all four abilities (reading, writing, speaking, listening). This maximizes both your core language points and skill transferability points.

### 2. Gain Canadian work experience
Each year of Canadian work experience adds significant points. Even 1 year makes a big difference (35-40 points), and 5+ years gives you maximum points (70-80 points).

### 3. Pursue higher education
A Master's degree or Ph.D. maximizes your education points and also contributes to skill transferability points when combined with language or work experience.

### 4. Apply while young
Ages 20-29 get maximum age points (100-110 points). Points decrease significantly after age 30 and drop to zero at age 45+.

### 5. Learn French
Bilingualism adds 25-50 bonus points. If you achieve NCLC 7 or higher in French and CLB 5 or higher in English, you get 50 additional points.

### 6. Get a provincial nomination
This adds 600 points instantly and virtually guarantees an invitation to apply. Research Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) that match your profile.

### 7. Obtain Canadian credentials
Studying in Canada for a post-secondary credential adds 15-30 bonus points on top of your education points.

### 8. Consider your spouse's contribution
If your spouse has strong credentials, including them can add up to 40 points. However, if you have much stronger credentials than your spouse, you might score higher applying without them (as you get more points in the core factors).

### 9. Focus on combinations
Skill transferability points reward combinations. For example, having both Canadian work experience and foreign work experience, or having education plus high language scores, can add up to 100 additional points.
